# About the PolicyGenerator plugin

See the [PolicyGenerator reference YAML](./policygenerator-reference.yaml) to see the full structure
of the PolicyGenerator manifest.

## The Kustomize exec plugin explained

The policy generator plugin is a binary written in Go. The binary accepts an input manifest of the
`PolicyGenerator` kind in the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1` API. When Kustomize finds a
manifest of that kind under the `generators:` array in `kustomization.yaml`, it looks in its
directories for a binary of the same name ("PolicyGenerator") in the
`policy.open-cluster-management.io/vi/policygenerator` directory and calls the binary as
`<path>/PolicyGenerator <cached-manifest>` to run the generator as its plugin. The flag
`--enable-alpha-plugins` must be specified in the Kustomize command in order for the external
generator plugin to be enabled.

## Placement

By default, a Placement and PlacementBinding are created for each policy with the policy name as the
suffix. To signal that you'd like to consolidate policies that use the same Placement under a single
PlacementBinding, either specify `placement.placementRulePath` to an existing Placement manifest or
set `placement.name` along with `placement.clusterSelectors`. When the PlacementBinding is
consolidated in this way, `placementBindingDefaults.name` must be specified so that the generator
can create unique names for the bindings.
