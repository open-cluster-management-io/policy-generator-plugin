  # Optional. This is how often a policy should be evaluated when in a particular compliance state. When managed
  # clusters have low CPU resources, the evaluation interval can be increased to to reduce CPU usage on the Kubernetes
  # API.
  evaluationInterval:

      # Supported manifests:
      #   1) Non-root policy type manifests such as IamPolicy, CertificatePolicy, and ConfigurationPolicy that have a
      #      "Policy" suffix. These are not modified except for patches and are directly added as a Policy's
      #      policy-templates entry.
