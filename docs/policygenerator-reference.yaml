  # Optional. When a policy is part of a policy set, by default the generator will not generate the placement for this

      # not process any YAML files in the subdirectory if a kustomization.yaml file is found.
      # Supported manifests:
      #   1) Non-root policy type manifests such as CertificatePolicy and ConfigurationPolicy that have a
      #      "Policy" suffix. These are not modified except for patches and are directly added as a Policy's
      #      policy-templates entry.
      #   2) Manifests containing only an `object-templates-raw` key. The corresponding value will be used directly in
      #      a generated ConfigurationPolicy without modification, which will then be added as a Policy's 
      #      policy-templates entry.
      #   3) For everything else, ConfigurationPolicy objects are generated to wrap these manifests. The resulting
      #      ConfigurationPolicy is added as a Policy's policy-templates entry.
